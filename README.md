Game Description: Packages need to be sent out of the factory in the timely fashion! Work against the clock to get as many
correct shipments out of the factory! What highscore can you reach? 

## Premise

You have 3 types of boxes you need to work with:

![Screenshot](Images/fragileBox.png) Fragile Box | Chance Of Breaking | 

![Screenshot](Images/heavyBox.png) Heavy Box | Slows Movement | 

![Screenshot](Images/box.png) Box | Just A Box | 

These three boxes will have an effect on your player! 

You have to make sure that when the orders come in, you get the right stickers or bubble wrap on the box with these three stations:

Make sure that your box is also safe!
